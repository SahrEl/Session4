#### Exercise 4D:

We are asked to play with different vector size and observe the running times of the program.

Here is how the execution time varies between 1 to 4 threads :

**Note**: Execution time will vary depending of the machine executing the code.

#### Exercise 4E-G

Here we need to submit the program to *AlphaCruncher* using 1 to 8 threads with
different array length (between 10'000 to 500'000'000). We decided to go with 10'000, 100'000'000 and 500'000'000.

For each array length we submitted the program with 1 to 8 threads. The execution time looks as follow:
